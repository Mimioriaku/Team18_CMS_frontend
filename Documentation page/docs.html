                    <h3>1.1 INTRODUCTION</h3><br><br>
                    <p> A Content Management System (CMS) is a web application 
                        designed to allow users to collaboratively create, store, 
                        edit, review, index, search, publish and archive various 
                        kinds of digital media and electronic text.                        
                        A CMS provides a graphical user interface with tools 
                        to create, edit and publish web content without need 
                        to write a code from scratch. It has two components: 
                        a content management application (CMA) and a content 
                        delivery application (CDA).                       
                        The CMA is a graphical user interface that enables 
                        users to design, create, modify and remove content 
                        from a website without HTML knowledge.
                        The CDA component provides the back-end services that 
                        support management and delivery of the content once a user creates it in the CMA.
                        Any user with administration rights over a website can 
                        use the Content Management System to create free-form 
                        content throughout the site. Some of these websites are:
                        WordPress: WordPress is the world’s most popular CMS by 
                        far. It powers over 37% of all websites on the Internet. 
                        It started as a blogging platform but has long-since morphed 
                        into a full CMS that you can use to build any type of website, from ecommerce stores to membership sites, forums, and more.
                        Drupal: another popular open source CMS that fits in the same 
                        space as WordPress.
                        With its flexible taxonomy system, Drupal excels when it comes 
                        to managing sites with large amounts of content. It also has a 
                        built-in user access system that gives you plenty of control 
                        over what registered users can do inside the CMS.
                        Like WordPress, you can control how your site looks using 
                        themes and extend Drupal’s functionality with modules.
                        Joomla :Joomla comes with large marketplaces for templates 
                        and extensions, which helps you create a website that matches 
                        your needs just like WordPress and Drupal .
                        In terms of the technical knowledge that’s required, Joomla 
                        offers a nice middle-ground between WordPress and Drupal.

                    <h3>1.2 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</h3><br><br>
                    <p> The study of  CMS centers on creating
                        a platform that will offer the best 
                        services of building basic websites 
                        such as landIng page, portfolio websites,
                        blog and other basic websites to the masses 
                        which will enable its users to create,edit,
                        remove and publish web content to the best 
                        of their interest; without  knowledge in coding.
                        it will also allow the users to download and save 
                        their edited template. In the design of this web app, 
                        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django.

                    <h3>1.3 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS</h3><br><br>
                    <p>This project work will be basically 
                        designed for FORGE which will provide 
                        better customer service like contact 
                        form and live chats Incase of any enquiry.
                        At the first phase of this project, which 
                        is data gathering, challenges were faced due 
                        to the fact that research data was difficult 
                        to gather at the initial time.

                    <p>In this study, the researchers hope 
                        to achieve the following objectives:
                        To develop a user friendly system 
                        with navigation ease for FORGE.
                        Allow users to easily create a 
                        website from pre-existing templates 
                        or by importing theirs.
                        Allow easy modification of 
                        templates with the ability to save work for future use.
                        Download website templates.
                        Publish Website with a custom Universal

                        the systematic process used for building 
                        software and ensuring the correctness and 
                        quality of the software built. It is a process 
                        used for planning, creating, testing and 
                        implementing an information system.
                        In this project, a waterfall model

                    <h3>2.4 REQUIREMENT ELICITATION</h3>
                    <p> The process of software development 
                        of the knowledge processes among which
                        are requirement elicitation processes. 
                        The purpose of requirement elicitation 
                        is to gain knowledge about the user's requirement. 
                        Requirement elicitation involves technical staff 
                        working with users to find out about the application 
                        domain, the services the system should provide and 
                        the system operational constraints. In this project, 
                        the Brainstorming and Interviewing method was used 
                        for the elicitation technique. Brainstorming: This 
                        is a great technique used to accomplish a variety of 
                        business analysis activities. It is used in requirement 
                        elicitation to get as many ideas as possible from a group 
                        of people in order to identify possible solutions to problems. 
                        During this process, system analysts of like minds were approached 
                        to discuss the proposed system. With this method, information was 
                        gathered on how the system should look like, how the interface 
                        should look, how the system should interact with its user, and 
                        how the system should respond to the user’s request. An Interview 
                        can be a structured or unstructured form, either written or printed. 
                        It consists of a formalized set of questions designed to collect some 
                        information on some subject or subjects from respondents. The questions 
                        may be a combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions. 
                        This method is frequently the best source of gathering qualitative 
                        information. It is useful for those who could not communicate effectively 
                        in writing or those who may not have time to complete a questionnaire.

                    <h3>2.8.1  CLASS DIAGRAM</h3>
                    <p> Class diagrams are used when developing an 
                        object oriented system model to show the classes 
                        in a system and the associations between these classes. 
                        Loosely, an object class can be thought of as a general 
                        definition of one kind of system object. An association is a 
                        link that indicates that there is a relationship between these classes.

                    <p> An activity diagram is a behavioral diagram 
                        that depicts the behavior of a system. 
                        It portrays the control flow from the start 
                        point to a finish point showing the various 
                        paths that exist while the activity is being executed.

                    <p> The database for this system has been designed 
                        with MYSQL. This is due to its reliability, 
                        flexibility, ease of use, popularity and cost efficiency. 
                        The database includes the following tables: Table 1 gives 
                        the users database design, Table 2 gives the original template 
                        database design, while Table 3 presents user template database design.

                    <p> Before implementing the actual design of the product, 
                        a few user interface designs were constructed to visualize 
                        the interaction with the system as they browse for templates, create a website and publish a site.
                        The main functions of the system include Building website, 
                        Editing Templates, Website Management and implementation of 
                        user login and registration. Also, the System Supports MYSQL 
                        which interacts with databases and performs data Manipulation.

                    <h3>3.6.1    UNIT TESTING</h3>
                    <p> Unit testing is a type of testing 
                        in which an individual unit is checked 
                        to ensure the correctness of an isolated code. 
                        A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. 
                        It mainly has one or few inputs and produces a single output.
